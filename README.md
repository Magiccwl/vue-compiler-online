A compiler online tool base on vue.js. When I read vuejs' source code, it's a little bit hard to figure out the detail of compilation process. Sometimes I need to debug anywhere and see the result, it's a good idea. But, debugging is not an efficient way to see source code, cuz you need debug repeately so many times. Also for someone who does care about the process, they just wanna take a look the result of compilation or the render function, so you can stick your template code here, the tool will generate something you want. Also it's a good way to understand the compilation process when you read the vuejs source code first time. Enjoy it. ðŸ’—
