A compiler online tool base on vue.js. When I saw vuejs source code, it's a litte bit hard to figure out the detail of compilation process. Sometimes I need to debug anywhere and see the result, it's a good idea. But, debugging is not a efficient way to see source code, cuz you need debug repeately so many times. Also for someone who does care about the process, they just wanna take a look the result of compilation or the render function, so you can stick your template code here, the tool will generate something your want. Also it's a good way to understand the compilation process when you read the vuejs source code first time. Enjoy it. ðŸ’—
